# Data flow in the application

This doc describes the relationships between different app pars and how the data flow works there.


### Screen <-> Manager data flow

* every `screen` suppose to have its own `manager` 
* `screen` subscribes for the `manager` state changes
* all user interactions (actions) are delivered to the `manager`
* `manager` takes care on the user action and how to react onto it
* in case of need, `manager` can:
    * trigger `useCase` to fetch some data
    * subscribe for the `useCase` events (continuous stream events)
    * trigger UI updates
        - open another screen
        - show dialog/snackbar
    * emit updated state back to the `screen`
